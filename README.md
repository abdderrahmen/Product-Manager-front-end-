# Product-Manager-front-end-

 You should only need to update the global installation of : npm install -g expo-cli 
 This project was bootstrapped with :

## Installation

`expo init myapp`
`cd myapp`
`npm start # you can also use: expo start.`

 Open it in the Expo app on your phone to view it and scan the QRCode displayed in the terminal
 It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

 Or with:
 npm run ios
 Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

 Or:
 npm run android
 Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator.
 Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native docs for detailed setup).
 We also recommend installing Genymotion as your Android emulator.
